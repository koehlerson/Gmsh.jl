# Tutorial 3

## Extruded meshes, options

```@example t3
import gmsh
```

```@example t3
gmsh.initialize()
```

```@example t3
gmsh.model.add("t3")
```

Copied from t1.jl...

```@example t3
lc = 1e-2
gmsh.model.geo.addPoint(0, 0, 0, lc, 1)
gmsh.model.geo.addPoint(.1, 0,  0, lc, 2)
gmsh.model.geo.addPoint(.1, .3, 0, lc, 3)
gmsh.model.geo.addPoint(0, .3, 0, lc, 4)
gmsh.model.geo.addLine(1, 2, 1)
gmsh.model.geo.addLine(3, 2, 2)
gmsh.model.geo.addLine(3, 4, 3)
gmsh.model.geo.addLine(4, 1, 4)
gmsh.model.geo.addCurveLoop([4, 1, -2, 3], 1)
gmsh.model.geo.addPlaneSurface([1], 1)
gmsh.model.geo.synchronize()
gmsh.model.addPhysicalGroup(0, [1, 2], 1)
gmsh.model.addPhysicalGroup(1, [1, 2], 2)
gmsh.model.addPhysicalGroup(2, [1], 6)
gmsh.model.setPhysicalName(2, 6, "My surface")
```

As in `t2.jl', we plan to perform an extrusion along the z axis.  But here,
instead of only extruding the geometry, we also want to extrude the 2D
mesh. This is done with the same `extrude()' function, but by specifying
element 'Layers' (2 layers in this case, the first one with 8 subdivisions and
the second one with 2 subdivisions, both with a height of h/2). The number of
elements for each layer and the (end) height of each layer are specified in
two vectors:

```@example t3
h = 0.1
angle = 90.
ov = gmsh.model.geo.extrude([(2,1)], 0, 0, h, [8,2], [0.5,1])
```

The extrusion can also be performed with a rotation instead of a translation,
and the resulting mesh can be recombined into prisms (we use only one layer
here, with 7 subdivisions). All rotations are specified by an an axis point
(-0.1, 0, 0.1), an axis direction (0, 1, 0), and a rotation angle (-Pi/2):

```@example t3
ov = gmsh.model.geo.revolve([(2,28)], -0.1,0,0.1, 0,1,0, -pi/2, [7])
```

Using the built-in geometry kernel, only rotations with angles < Pi are
supported. To do a full turn, you will thus need to apply at least 3
rotations. The OpenCASCADE geometry kernel does not have this limitation.

A translation (-2*h, 0, 0) and a rotation ((0,0.15,0.25), (1,0,0), Pi/2) can
also be combined to form a "twist".  The last (optional) argument for the
extrude() and twist() functions specifies whether the extruded mesh should be
recombined or not.

```@example t3
ov = gmsh.model.geo.twist([(2,50)], 0,0.15,0.25, -2*h,0,0, 1,0,0,
                          angle*pi/180., [10], [], true)
```

```@example t3
gmsh.model.geo.synchronize()
```

All the extrusion functions return a vector of extruded entities: the "top" of
the extruded surface (in `ov[0]'), the newly created volume (in `ov[1]') and
the tags of the lateral surfaces (in `ov[2]', `ov[3]', ...).

We can then define a new physical volume (with tag 101) to group all the
elementary volumes:

```@example t3
gmsh.model.addPhysicalGroup(3, [1, 2, ov[2][2]], 101)
```

```@example t3
gmsh.model.mesh.generate(3)
gmsh.write("t3.msh")
```

```@example t3
gmsh.finalize()
```
